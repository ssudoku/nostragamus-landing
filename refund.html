      <p>A detailed explanation of Nostragamus refund policy is mentioned under the following points:</p>
      <h3>Cancellation of Games</h3>
      <p>Nostragamus is not responsible for any loss resulting from the cancellation of games due to service outages caused by failures of our service providers, computer viruses, natural disasters or any other reason which is beyond our control. You acknowledge that you will not be entitled to any refund due to cancellation of games caused by factors which are beyond the reasonable control of Nostragamus.</p>
      <h3>Online Transactions</h3>
      <p>Money credited to your cash account has to be made through third-party payment gateways. Nostragamus is not responsible for the denial of any transaction as they are subjected to the terms and conditions specified by third-party payment gateways. Nostragamus may reverse any transaction and the specific amount would be refunded to the financial instrument which was used by you to perform the transaction.</p>
      <h3>Account Validation</h3>
      <p>Nostragamus has the right to validate the personal information of the players from time to time. The process of validation can be done through phone call or via email. When we are not able to get in touch with you, several attempts will be made to establish contact with you. In case of an event where the validation is unsuccessful or we are unable to contact you after making all possible attempts, we reserve the right to suspend your account and refund the amount lying in your account to the financial instrument that you have used to make online payment.</p>
      <h3>Promotions</h3>
      <p>Nostragamus contests, offers, bonuses, tournaments and games under the Promotion Section at Nostragamus may get cancelled or discontinued at any moment without prior notice. Nostragamus disclaims any liability, except refund of entry fee wherever applicable.</p>
      <h3>Refund Requests</h3>
      <p>In cases of accidental or erroneous cash credit to any party, user or company, we can independently or you can request for refund within 2 weeks of initiating the transaction. Nostragamus will process the refund if it is a genuine case of accidental or erroneous cash credit, based on your request or our own independent investigation. The refund will be carried out and the amount will be credited within 2 weeks to the financial instrument which was used to perform the corresponding transaction.</p>
