      <h1 class="page-title">About Us</h1>
      <p>We started off as a sports news website about a year and a half back, and are now developing a gaming app called Nostragamus.</p>
      <p>Unlike other sports-based gaming apps, our app is simple - all you have to do is answer a couple of prediction-based questions for live matches happening in football.  We setup short 2-3 day long challenges, based,  on EPL gameweeks, or Champions League Rounds.  Users need to predict events in these matches.  Correct predictions win points, and points accumulated over a challenge decide the winner.  Winners will be given money as prizes.</p>
      <h3>Format</h3>
      <p>In one sentence, the game is about predictions based on live matches in a format that's extremely easy to understand.  All you need to do is select the tournament, play the matches and wait for the results.</p>
      <h3>Modes of Play</h3>
      <p>There are two modes of play.  You can either play against all players participating in a tournament, or you can create your own private group and play in that - whatever you're comfortable with.</p>
      <h3>Tournaments Covered</h3>
      <p>Right now, we're covering top 6 teams in EPL, Barca and Real in La Liga and Bayern Munich in Bundesliga.  We're also covering all international cricket matches.  In case you want us to cover a new sport, or new team, please drop in a line.  That's valuable feedback for us, and we'll try to do it this edition itself. </p>
      <h3>Rewards</h3>
      <p>Well, all questions highlight an interesting stat about players or teams, and throwing those stats at your friends will definitely show you in a knowledgeable light :)</p>
      <p>Apart from that, we're in the process of installing a wallet system in the game when we go live, and we'll load your wallets with something extra when it comes about.</p>
